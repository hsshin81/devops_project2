      - Create a CI/CD pipeline, so that whenever the code in commit in Github it will initiate CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins once it completes successfully then Jenkins will create a Docker image and will push Docker image to Dockerhub.  NOTE: You can use your localhost and build pipeline manually because you need public IP for webhook. So, I don`t want you to use webhook. I want you use simple python application. In Jenkinsfile, please have 3 stages called ‘Your Name - Build Docker Image’, ‘Your Name - Login to Dockerhub’ and ‘Your Name - Push image to Dockerhub’.      - Please explain your project and record yourself.     - You need to have Dockerhub account.
